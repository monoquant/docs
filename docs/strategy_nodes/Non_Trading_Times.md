## Define the times when the strategy will not trade
The Non-Trading Times node allows you to define the times when the strategy will not trade. This can be useful if you want to avoid trading during certain times of the day, such as when the market is closed or when there is low liquidity.

## How to use the Non-Trading Times node
The times for the Non-Trading Times node are defined in the format `HH:MM:SS`.

You can add multiple time ranges by adding more Non-Trading Times nodes to the strategy.
