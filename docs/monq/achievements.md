# Achievements

Our platform introduces an innovative Achievement Rewards System designed to incentivize user engagement and platform utilization through a series of progressive rewards. This system not only recognizes user milestones and expertise but also encourages competition, continuous learning, and adaptation to new market environments.

## Achievement Pool
Users will be rewarded from a dedicated "Achievement Pool," which is allocated specifically for recognizing and compensating users who reach significant milestones. Achievements such as "Generated $1M in Volume," "Created Your First AI Strategy," and "Utilized Multiple Timeframes in a Strategy" are examples of milestones that will trigger rewards.

## Payout Structure
The payout for each achievement is dynamically calculated based on the proportion of the Achievement Pool that has been utilized at the time of achievement. For instance, when 20% of the pool has been distributed, the payout for a new achievement will be calculated as Achievement Percentage x 0.9. This structure ensures a sustainable reward system that adjusts as more achievements are unlocked by the community.

## Seasonal Achievement Packs
To maintain engagement and introduce fresh challenges, we will release new "Achievement Packs" periodically, akin to seasons in video games. These packs will coincide with major updates or feature releases, ensuring that the achievements evolve in line with the platform's capabilities and user interests.

## Exclusive NFT Rewards
In addition to monetary rewards, the first user to unlock a particular achievement will receive an exclusive NFT, featuring unique artwork related to the achievement. This NFT acts as both a collectible and a mark of distinction, celebrating the user's pioneering spirit and expertise. Each NFT is one-of-a-kind, enhancing its value and desirability within our community. This will come with real-world assets (RWA) rewards also, such as prizes from our partners. Partners, such as exchanges, will also be able to create sponsored achievements with prizes, e.g. “Create $1m in Volume on x exchange”.
