# Staking

The Volume Staking system is strategically designed to boost engagement and active participation across our platform. By rewarding users and teams in proportion to the trading volume they generate alongside their stake, this system cultivates a dynamic and collaborative trading environment.

## Team Formation and Dynamics

Users have the opportunity to form or join teams by delegating a portion of their stakes to the DAO. This structure not only facilitates collective trading efforts but also empowers teams to self-govern. Teams can manage membership by retaining active members who contribute to the volume and removing those who do not. As teams generate more volume through their combined stakes, they can ascend through different tiers, gaining increased visibility and prestige on the platform.

## Incentives for Team Collaboration

Joining teams like “AI Degen” allows members to leverage their delegated stakes to collectively increase trading volume, enhancing their rewards and the team's status. Teams function similarly to individual users but with the combined strength and strategic advantage of multiple traders. Teams have private social space on the website for discussions, sharing of ideas, trading logic, and such, creating a sense of exclusivity for the members of the team.

## Role of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs)

Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) play a pivotal role by forming their own teams and offering exclusive content. They can set a "Minimum Delegated Stake" for accessing their specialized analyses or copy trading opportunities. This system is akin to a "Patreon" model but tailored for democratized trading, where access to premium content and strategies is gated by stake delegation, allowing KOLs to monetize their expertise while contributing to the platform's vibrancy and volume.

## Funding and Reward Distribution

Rewards within the Volume Staking system are derived from multiple sources to ensure stability and continual growth. These include:

- **Brokerage Fee Revenue**: A portion of the fees collected through our brokerage agreements with top cryptocurrency exchanges.
- **Automated DeFi Trading**: Fees generated from our token's involvement in automated decentralized finance (DeFi) trading strategies.

Payments to users are made using stablecoins, such as USDT or USDC, alongside our token, the distribution of which you can see in the below table.

Upon receipt, these funds are utilized to purchase our platform's native token from the open market. This action not only rewards users directly but also supports buy-side liquidity for our token consistently.
